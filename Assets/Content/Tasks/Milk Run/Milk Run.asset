  title: Milk Run
  description: 'Miss Hart. Arisana has a task that needs your specialist services.
    Details attached. Small time corp Saika have recently been making a lot of noise
    in the market, far in excess of what their publically communicated budget suggests
    they''re capable of. The only explanation is another corp fronting them the cash.
    Find out.

    I also had a new contractor starting working for me recently. I''d like you to
    take her along and observe how she handles herself. I''ve asked her to find you
    in the Arisana Contractor''s bar. Please collect her, complete the task as described
    and report back. Zero noise. This should be a milk run for someone as experienced
    as you.'
