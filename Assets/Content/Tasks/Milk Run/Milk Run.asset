  description: 'Miss Ives. As discussed previously, I have a task I need you to do.
    I''ve sent details to your A.I. Small time corp Saika has been making a lot of
    noise lately, than greater than their budget suggests they''re capable of. There
    must be another corp fronting them the cash. Find out who for me

    I also had a new contractor starting working for me recently. I''d like you to
    take her along and observe how she handles herself. You''ll find her waiting for
    you in the Arisana contractor bar. Please collect her from there, complete the
    task as described and report back to me. And this should be a milk run, so keep
    it simple and zero noise.
