  title: Contractor Quarter
  description: The major corps collectively built living space for their employed
    contract workers into this single sector. The projected aim was to make moving
    contractors between corps easier, but in truth, the desire appears to have been
    to segment the contractor population away from the corporate manager eschelon.
