  text: "Twas the night before christmas, when all through the city, all the creatures
    were stirring. Even a Mouse...\nThough, if I had my way, I'd leave the creatures
    to their stirring and stay here in my apartment where things are far... cleaner.
    \nSadly, I doubt there is any chance for that tonight."
