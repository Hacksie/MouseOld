            "description": "Ms Hart. Aisana has a task that needs your specialist services. Details attached. Small time corp Saika have recently been making a lot of noise in our shared market, far in excess of what their publically communicated budget suggests they're capable of. The only explanation is another corp fronting them the cash. Find out. I also had a new contractor starting working for me recently. I'd like you to take her along and observe how she handles herself. I've asked her to meet you. She suggest Aisana Contractor's bar. I'm guessing that's somewhere you lot would visit. Please collect her, complete the task as described and report back. Zero noise. I expect this to be a milk run for someone as experienced as you.",
